**DAY 2 SUBMISSION**

**Project:** Customer Behavior Analysis
**GitHub Link:** https://github.com/natnaelaster/Daily-exercise/tree/main/day_2_customer_segmentatio_analysis
**Tableau Link:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/natnael.birhanu/viz/day_2_customer_segmentation/Dashboard1

** Tasks**

-- Customer RFM Analysis:

Recency: Days since last purchase (use max invoice date as reference)
Frequency: Number of purchases per customer
Monetary: Total spending per customer

-- Customer Segmentation:

Create 4 segments using RFM scores:
Champions: Recent, frequent, high spending
Loyal Customers: Frequent but older purchases
At Risk: High spending but not recent
New/Casual: Recent but low frequency/spending

**Completed:**
✅ RFM calculation and segmentation
✅ Customer lifetime value analysis
✅ Purchasing frequency distribution
✅ Customer segmentation dashboard

**Key Insights:**

1. Our most valuable insight is that the largest customer group is "New/Casual" customers (2,308), 
followed by "Champions" (1,319), with "Loyal Customers" (448) and "At Risk" (264) 
making up smaller segments. This indicates a high influx of new or infrequent buyers, 
but also a strong core of highly engaged customers.

2. The customer segments show that while we have a solid base of Champions and Loyal Customers who 
purchase frequently and spend more, a significant portion of our customer base is at risk of churning or 
only purchases occasionally. The "At Risk" segment, though smaller, represents high spenders who have not
purchased recently and may require re-engagement.

3. For marketing, we recommend targeted retention campaigns for "At Risk" and "Loyal Customers" to 
encourage repeat purchases, and personalized onboarding or incentive offers for "New/Casual" customers to 
convert them into more engaged buyers. Special rewards or loyalty programs can help maintain and grow the
"Champions" segment.
