Executive summary
I have analyzed five years of transaction data to produce: 
    -product-level KPIs, time‑series exports and inventory estimates to support replenishment, promotions and SKU rationalization. 

** Methods **

* Aggregated sales by StockCode/Description to compute Total Revenue and Units Sold.
* Derived Sales Velocity = Units Sold / Days Active (First → Last sale).
* Built monthly time series per SKU for turnover, seasonality and trend analysis.
* Flagged stockout risk using coefficient of variation (CV) of monthly demand; 
    - identified declining SKUs by comparing last 3 months vs previous 3 months.

** Key results **

** Revenue & units

* Total Revenue and Units Sold computed per SKU (see Product_performance_file.csv).
* Top / Bottom performers
* Small set of SKUs drives a large share of revenue (ABC effect; top ~20% ≈ 80% of revenue).

** Sales velocity & movement

* Sales_velocity computed (units/day) and SKUs bucketed into Slow / Medium / Fast movement for differentiated replenishment rules.

** Inventory analysis

* Inventory turnover (units-based) estimated where OnHand exists: 
   - AnnualUnits / AvgOnHand.
* SafetyStock and ReorderPoint computed from AvgDailySales and demand volatility; 
   - EOQ included when cost parameters supplied (inventory_estimates_by_product.csv).

** Stockout risk

* 3‑tier stockout_risk flags generated from CV of monthly demand (low / medium / high) 
    — high CV SKUs need safety stock/shorter review cycles.

** Seasonality & trends

* Seasonality score (low/medium/high) from monthly std.
* 12 SKUs identified as Decline by 3‑month vs prior 3‑month comparison.
* (monthly_trend.csv) contains the monthly series for forecasting and visualization.

** Operational implications **

* Prioritize replenishment and lead‑time reduction for fast movers and Top‑A SKUs to avoid lost sales.
* Increase safety stock or shorten review cycles for high CV SKUs (stockout risk).
* Run 4–8 week promotional tests on declining SKUs; consider bundling/liquidation if no recovery.
* Use movement buckets to set review cadence: Fast = daily/weekly, Medium = weekly, Slow = monthly/quarterly.
* Align procurement calendar with seasonal SKU peaks.
